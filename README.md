# RetroThemesFirefox
<h2>A collection of old browser themes for Firefox.</h2><br>
To install a theme, place the "chrome" directory from the theme into your Firefox user profile directory. 
Set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to True in about:config and make sure to close all 
running instances of Firefox for the changes to take effect.
